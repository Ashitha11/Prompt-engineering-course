              "' The attention function is a way of mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, using vectors. It computes a weighted sum of the values, with the weights determined by the compatibility between the query and each key. This mechanism, known as self-attention or intra-attention, has been used successfully in various natural language processing tasks. Two commonly used attention functions are additive attention and dot-product attention, with the latter being identical to the algorithm described in section 3.2 except for a scaling factor. The use of masking and offset output embeddings ensures that the predictions for each position only depend on the known outputs at earlier positions.'"
